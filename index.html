							<h2>Andromeda galaxy</h2>
							<p>The Andromeda Galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy and is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. It was originally named the Andromeda Nebula and is cataloged as Messier 31, M31, and NGC 224. Andromeda has a diameter of about 46.56 kiloparsecs and is approximately 765 kpc from Earth.</p>

							<h2>Cigar Galaxy</h2>
							<p>Messier 82 (M82), or the Cigar Galaxy, is an edge-on spiral undergoing a massive burst of star formation in its core. Many thousands of stars, and their surrounding gas and dust, have been stirred up. These stars are expelling violent winds that are blowing gas and dust out of the galaxy.</p>

							<h2>Cartwheel Galaxy</h2>
							<p>The Cartwheel Galaxy is a lenticular ring galaxy about 500 million light-years away in the constellation Sculptor. It has a D₂₅ isophotal diameter of 44.23 kiloparsecs, and a mass of about 2.9–4.8 × 10⁹ solar masses; its outer ring has a circular velocity of 217 km/s. It was discovered by Fritz Zwicky in 1941.	</p>

							<h2>Large Magellanic Cloud</h2>
							<p>The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. At a distance of around 50 kiloparsecs, the LMC is the second- or third-closest galaxy to the Milky Way, after the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal and the possible dwarf irregular galaxy called the Canis Major Overdensity.</p>

							<h2>Sombrero Galaxy</h2>
							<p>The Sombrero Galaxy is a peculiar galaxy of unclear classification in the constellation borders of Virgo and Corvus, being about 9.55 megaparsecs from the Milky Way galaxy. It is a member of the Virgo II Groups, a series of galaxies and galaxy clusters strung out from the southern edge of the Virgo Supercluster.</p>
